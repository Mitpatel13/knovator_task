Architectural Choices
1. State Management
   The app uses GetX for state management due to its simplicity and reactivity. GetX provides:

Reactive State Management: Efficient and easy-to-use reactive state updates.
Navigation: Seamless navigation between screens without the need for context.
Dependency Injection: Lightweight dependency injection for controllers.
2. Code Structure
   The code is organized into the following layers:

Controllers: Manage business logic and interact with APIs/local storage.
Views: Represent the UI components and utilize controllers for data.
Widgets: Reusable UI components (e.g., TimerIcon).
